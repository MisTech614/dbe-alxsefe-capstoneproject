# dbe-alxsefe-capstoneproject
Welcome to my capstone project with ALX Africa's Front End Development Program!

Project Summary
FitTrack is a responsive fitness tracker web application built using React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Zustand. The application allows users to log workouts, view workout history, track fitness progress, and search exercises using real-world data from the WGER API.
The project was developed as part of the Capstone Project for ALX SEFE and demonstrates practical front-end engineering skills, including component-based design, state management, API integration, and responsive UI development.

Key Features
•	Log workouts with exercises, sets, reps, and weights
•	Persist workout data using local storage
•	View workout history organized by date
•	Track progress through calculated fitness metrics
•	Search exercises by name or muscle group
•	Fetch exercise data dynamically from the WGER API
•	Responsive design optimized for desktop and mobile

Technical Overview
•	React Hooks (useState, useEffect) manage local UI state and side effects
•	Zustand handles global state for workouts and exercise data
•	Tailwind CSS ensures consistent, responsive styling
•	API integration includes loading and error handling for reliability

Learning Outcome
This project strengthened my understanding of modern front-end development, particularly API-driven applications, global state management, and debugging React hook issues. It reflects real-world challenges and showcases my ability to build scalable, user-focused web applications.
